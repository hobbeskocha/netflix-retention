# Improving Customer Retention for Netflix

## Overview

This is a data analysis project conducted by [Ayush Shrestha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayush-yoshi-shrestha/), as part of a team project for BUS AN 512 for University Washington MSBA program.

The project analyzes a synthetic dataset (originally retrieved from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/netflix-userbase-dataset)) of Netflix customer records.
The analysis was performed using MySQL and Power BI, consisting of exploratory data analysis and data visualizations to investigate the different retention rates and usage patterns of Netflix customers.

While the data contains a wealth of insights, one of the most noteworthy is that North American (NA) customers aged 41-50, which comprise 35% of the NA market, have a 5% lower retention rate, suggesting the opportunity for a 1.75% retention increase through targeted marketing.
