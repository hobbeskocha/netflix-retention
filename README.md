# Improving Customer Retention for Netflix

## Overview

This is a data analysis project (focussed on MySQL and Power BI) conducted by [Ayush Shrestha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ayush-yoshi-shrestha/), as part of a team project for BUS AN 512 (Data Management and Visualization) for the University of Washington's Master of Science in Business Analytics program.

The project analyzed a synthetic dataset (originally retrieved from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/netflix-userbase-dataset)) of Netflix customer records.

## Business Problem

As competition in the streaming market intensifies, Netflix must leverage its wealth of customer data to refine its retention strategies and maintain audience engagement. Without these efforts, certain customer segments may start disengaging from the platform, which in the worst case would lead to increased churn through unsubscribing. By utilizing data-driven strategies, Netflix can gain insights into retention trends across its customer base, identify high-risk segments prone to churn, and tailor its marketing efforts, content acquisition, and production strategies to re-engage and retain those viewers effectively.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset consists of approximately 2,500 synthetic records of Netflix customers, containing attributes such as:

- subscription plan
- last payment date
- country of residence
- age
- preferred device type

Since the data is synthetic, it is already clean, not requiring any additional preprocessing before analysis. This allows us to jump directly into deriving insights from the dataset.

## Pre-processing

For ease of data ingestion into MySQL Workbench, the original CSV file was converted into a SQL DDL script using an online tool. During the conversion, several key parameters were configured to ensure accuracy, including:

- defining the primary key
- enforcing data integrity constraints (such as non-null values for certain columns)
- adding a DROP TABLE statement at the beginning of the script for easy reusability

This approach streamlined the setup process and ensured the data was properly structured for analysis.

## EDA

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted using MySQL to examine the distribution of customers across available factors, such as:

- geographic region
- subscription plan
- preferred device type.

Additionally, descriptive statistics, including ranges and averages, were calculated for various segments to assess data spread and central tendencies. This preliminary analysis provided a comprehensive overview of the dataset, positioning us to proceed with an in-depth analysis of customer retention rates.

## Analysis

Focusing on retention rates, we first assumed that a last payment date before December 2023 indicates an inactive account i.e., the customer has likely churned and unsubscribed. With this assumption, Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and CASE statements were utilized to group the data more effectively. This included:

- organizing individual countries into their respective continents
- segmenting customers into age buckets
- creating a binary "active" column to indicate whether a customer is currently active (1) or inactive (0)

From there we could compare the active customer count against the total, enabling the calculation of retention rates across various segments. Additionally, a secondary result set was generated to analyze the relationship between a customer's "active" status and their subscription tenure (length of time subscribed to Netflix). This would aid in uncovering insights into how customer loyalty, measured by years of subscription, impacts retention rates.

The results from these queries were exported to CSV files and uploaded into Power BI for visualization and further analysis. The Power BI workbook, available [here](analysis/netflix-data-viz.pbix), provides a comprehensive analysis of retention rates against customer tenure, age, and continent. It also highlights retention trends in Netflixâ€™s two largest markets, Europe and North America, with a focus on age and preferred device type.

## Findings & Recommendations

While the data contains a wealth of insights, one of the most noteworthy is that North American (NA) customers aged 41-50, which comprise 35% of the NA market, have a 5% lower retention rate, suggesting the opportunity for a 1.75% retention increase through targeted marketing.
